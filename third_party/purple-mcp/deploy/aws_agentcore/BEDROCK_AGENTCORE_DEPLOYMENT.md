# Purple AI MCP - Deployment on Amazon Bedrock Agent Core

This guide will take you through deploying the Purple AI MCP Server to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

> **NOTE:** A SentinelOne account is required to obtain the console token needed for
> authentication.

## Prerequisites

**Obtain a Sentinelone Singularity Operations Center console token**

This can be found in Policy & Settings → User Management → Service Users in your console.
Currently, this server only supports tokens that have access to a single Account or Site. If you
need to access multiple sites, you will need to run multiple MCP servers with Account-specific or
Site-specific tokens.

**Prepare Environment Variables**

```bash
PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL=https://your-console.sentinelone.net
PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN=your-token
MCP_MODE=streamable-http
PURPLEMCP_STATELESS_HTTP=True
```

**Prepare AWS Environment**

### VPC Configuration

**Outbound internet access** - Outbound internet access should be permitted through an Internet
Gateway or NAT Gateway. \
 **Security Groups** - Allow outbound HTTPS on port 443 to connect to the Sentinelone service.

It is important to note that Purple AI MCP does not include built-in authentication. For network
exposed AWS deployments, ensure the MCP Server is placed behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
with the appropriate timeout settings. Detailed information on cloud setups can be found
[here](../cloud/CLOUD_SETUP.md#cloud-load-balancer-setup).

### IAM Configuration

When deploying Purple AI MCP via AWS Marketplace a 'default' service role will be automatically
created. To use a customer-managed service role reference the IAM Policy below.

[Trust Policy](bedrock-agentcore-trust-policy.json) \
[IAM Policy](bedrock-agentcore-iam-policy.json)

## Agent Core Configuration Settings

When configuring the MCP in Bedrock Agent core, set the following.

1. **Name** - Give the deployment a suitable name and description.
2. **Agent Source** - Default (ECR) as this is automatically populated via AWS Marketplace.
3. **IAM Permissions** - Default service role or create a custom service role based on the IAM
   Configuration step [above](#iam-configuration).
4. **Protocol** - Set to MCP.
5. **Inbound Identity Type** - Select JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or IAM.
   - **JWT** - Requires IdP bearer tokens to invoke the agent.
   - **IAM** - Requires relevant IAM Permissions to invoke the agent.
6. **Security Type** - Select VPC and set the relevant VPC, Subnets & Security Groups.
7. **Advanced Settings** - Add environment variables as noted in the
   [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
8. Click **Host Agent** to complete the setup.

The Agent will take around ~1-2 minutes to become active.

## Example deployment with AWS CLI

```bash
aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-agent-runtime \
  --region <region> \
  --agent-runtime-name "purpleaimcp" \
  --description "Purple AI MCP Server Agent" \
  --agent-runtime-artifact '{
    "containerConfiguration": {
      "containerUri": "709825985650.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sentinelone/purple-ai-mcp-server:latest"
    }
  }' \
  --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::{{accountId}}:role/your-role-name" \
  --network-configuration '{
    "networkMode": "PUBLIC"
  }' \
  --protocol-configuration '{
    "serverProtocol": "MCP"
  }' \
  --environment-variables '{
    "PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL": "https://your-console.sentinelone.net",
    "PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN": "your-token",
    "MCP_MODE": "streamable-http",
    "PURPLEMCP_STATELESS_HTTP": "True"
  }'
```

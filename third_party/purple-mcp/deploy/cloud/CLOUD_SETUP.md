# Cloud Setup

This guide sets up Purple MCP with authentication for release use.

## Requirements

**Docker versions:**

- Docker Engine 20.10+ (or Docker Desktop 4.0+)
- Docker Compose V2 (2.0+)

The release deployments use security hardening features (`security_opt`, `cap_drop`) that require
these minimum versions.

**Verify your versions:**

```bash
docker --version        # Should show 20.10.0+
docker compose version  # Should show v2.0.0+
```

**Note:** Use `docker compose` (V2, with space) not `docker-compose` (V1, deprecated).

## Quick Reference

Build the image locally before deployment:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t purple-mcp:latest .

# Or use docker compose to build
docker compose build
```

## Quick Start

> **Note**: This quick start uses nginx for simplicity. For release deployments on AWS, GCP, or
> Azure, we recommend using native cloud load balancers (ALB, Cloud Load Balancing, or Application
> Gateway). See [Cloud Load Balancer Setup](#cloud-load-balancer-setup) for configuration details.

### 1. Generate credentials and token

```bash
# Create .env file with your SentinelOne credentials
cat > .env << EOF
PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN=your_service_token
PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL=https://your-console.sentinelone.net
PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
PURPLEMCP_ENV=release
EOF

chmod 600 .env
```

### 2. Generate SSL certificates

**For testing/staging only (NOT for release environments):**

```bash
mkdir -p ssl
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -keyout ssl/key.pem -out ssl/cert.pem \
  -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=your-domain.com"
```

**WARNING: Self-signed certificates above are for development/testing only. Never use self-signed
certificates in release deployments.**

**For release deployments with Let's Encrypt:**

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/ssl:/etc/letsencrypt certbot/certbot \
  certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com

# Copy certificates to expected location
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem ssl/cert.pem
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem ssl/key.pem
```

### 3. Start the services

```bash
# Start with release profile (includes reverse proxy with auth)
docker compose --profile release up -d

# Verify services are running
docker compose ps
```

### 4. Test

```bash
# Get the auth token
TOKEN=$(grep PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN .env | cut -d= -f2)

# Test with authentication
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost/
```

## Architecture

This guide covers the nginx reverse proxy setup, which works well for development and self-hosted
deployments. For release deployments on AWS, GCP, or Azure, we recommend using your cloud
provider's native load balancer (Application Load Balancer, Cloud Load Balancing, or Application
Gateway) instead. See [Cloud Load Balancer Setup](#cloud-load-balancer-setup) for details.

**Nginx architecture:**

```
Client → nginx (443) → Purple MCP (8000) → SentinelOne API
```

**Cloud load balancer architecture:**

```
Client → ALB/GCLB/App Gateway (443) → Purple MCP (8000) → SentinelOne API
```

Cloud load balancers provide managed SSL certificates, better DDoS protection, simpler horizontal
scaling, and avoid the nginx rate limiting issues described below.

### How Auth Works

The nginx config uses environment variable substitution. At startup, `envsubst` replaces
`${PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN}` in the template with your actual token from the environment. This means
the token is never hardcoded in the config file - it's only in memory at runtime.

### Rate Limiting Limitation

The nginx configuration has a known limitation with rate limiting. Due to nginx's request
processing phases, authentication failures (401/403 responses) occur before rate limiting is
applied. This means an attacker can make unlimited authentication attempts without being throttled.

**Mitigation**: Use a cryptographically strong random token with sufficient entropy. A 256-bit
token (32 bytes) makes brute force attacks computationally infeasible even without rate limiting:

```bash
# Recommended: Base64-encoded (URL-safe characters)
openssl rand -base64 32

# Alternative: Hexadecimal
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**Token Requirements:**

- Use only base64 or hexadecimal characters (alphanumeric + `/+=` for base64, `0-9a-f` for hex)
- Minimum 32 bytes of entropy (generates 44+ character base64 or 64 character hex string)
- It's safe to quote tokens in `.env` files (quotes will be stripped by Docker)
- Avoid special shell characters that might cause issues: `$`, backticks, `\`, `!` (in some shells)

For deployments requiring rate limiting on authentication failures, consider using a cloud load
balancer with WAF rules or moving authentication to the application layer.

## Monitoring

### View logs

```bash
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose logs -f purple-mcp-proxy
docker compose logs -f purple-mcp-streamable-http
```

### Check authentication

```bash
# View auth failures
docker compose logs purple-mcp-proxy | grep "Unauthorized"

# Monitor in real-time
docker compose logs -f purple-mcp-proxy | grep -E "Unauthorized|Forbidden"

# Verify token validation is working (should be rejected)
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" https://localhost/

# Verify correct token is accepted
TOKEN=$(grep PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN .env | cut -d= -f2)
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost/
```

### Verify token is NOT hardcoded

The nginx configuration uses environment variable substitution for security. You can verify the
token is properly substituted:

```bash
# The template file should contain ${PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN} placeholder
grep "PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN" deploy/nginx/nginx.conf.template

# Verify the placeholder was substituted (check that literal string is absent)
docker exec purple-mcp-proxy grep '\${PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN}' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
# Should return nothing (exit code 1) - confirms envsubst replaced the placeholder

# Verify the running config contains your actual token value
TOKEN=$(grep PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN .env | cut -d= -f2)
docker exec purple-mcp-proxy grep "$TOKEN" /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
# Should find matches (exit code 0) - confirms your token is active in nginx
```

### Health checks

The nginx proxy changes health endpoint behavior for security:

- **Backend `/health`** (direct): Publicly accessible, no authentication
- **Proxy `/health`**: Requires bearer token authentication
- **Proxy `/internal/health`**: IP-restricted to internal networks only (localhost IPv4
  `127.0.0.1`, localhost IPv6 `::1`, and Docker bridge networks `172.16.0.0/12`)

Docker health checks use the IP-restricted `/internal/health` endpoint. For external monitoring:

```bash
TOKEN=$(grep PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN .env | cut -d= -f2)

# Authenticated health check
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost/health

# Or any authenticated endpoint
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost/
```

## Maintenance

### Update token

```bash
# Generate new token
NEW_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Update .env
sed -i "s/PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN=.*/PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$NEW_TOKEN/" .env

# Restart proxy
docker compose restart purple-mcp-proxy
```

### Renew Let's Encrypt certificate

```bash
# Renew (should be automatic with certbot)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/ssl:/etc/letsencrypt certbot/certbot renew

# Restart proxy
docker compose restart purple-mcp-proxy
```

### Renew self-signed certificate (testing only)

**WARNING: Self-signed certificates are for testing only, not release deployments.**

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -keyout ssl/key.pem -out ssl/cert.pem \
  -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=your-domain.com"

docker compose restart purple-mcp-proxy
```

## Troubleshooting

### Services won't start

```bash
docker compose logs

# Validate nginx config template
export PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$(grep PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN .env | cut -d= -f2)
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/deploy/nginx/nginx.conf.template:/tmp/nginx.conf.template:ro \
  -e PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN \
  nginx:1.27-alpine sh -c 'envsubst "\$PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN" < /tmp/nginx.conf.template > /etc/nginx/nginx.conf && nginx -t'
```

### Certificate issues

```bash
# Check expiration
openssl x509 -in ssl/cert.pem -noout -dates

# View certificate details
openssl x509 -in ssl/cert.pem -text -noout
```

### Port already in use

Either change the port in `docker-compose.yml` or stop the conflicting service:

```bash
lsof -i :443
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Can't connect to SentinelOne

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs purple-mcp-streamable-http

# Verify credentials are correct
# - Token must be Account or Site level (not Global)
# - Token must not be expired
# - Base URL must be reachable from container
```

## Configuration Reference

### Environment Variables

See [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml) for a complete list. Key release environment
variables:

- `PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN` - Bearer token for proxy authentication (required)
- `PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN` - SentinelOne service user token
- `PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL` - SentinelOne console URL
- `PURPLEMCP_ENV` - Set to `release`

### Nginx Configuration

See [deploy/nginx/nginx.conf.template](../nginx/nginx.conf.template) for the reverse proxy
configuration template. The template uses `envsubst` to inject `PURPLEMCP_AUTH_TOKEN` at runtime.
Notable features:

- Bearer token validation (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
- HTTPS/TLS with modern ciphers
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Rate limiting (10 req/s)
- Streaming support for MCP
- Health check endpoint (no auth required)

### Security Hardening

The release profile (`docker compose --profile release`) includes security hardening:

- **`no-new-privileges:true`**: Prevents privilege escalation within containers
- **`cap_drop: ALL`**: Drops all Linux capabilities; services run with minimal privileges
- **Read-only volumes**: Configuration and SSL certificates mounted as read-only

These settings follow the principle of least privilege. The containers can still function normally
for their intended purpose (running Python/nginx) but cannot perform privileged operations.

## Cloud Load Balancer Setup

Purple MCP uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses, which requires long-lived HTTP
connections. The critical configuration across all cloud providers is the idle timeout - default
values are typically too short and will cause connections to drop.

Purple MCP runs in stateless mode, meaning each request is independent and session state is not
maintained. This simplifies deployment: you don't need sticky sessions or session affinity, and you
can scale horizontally by adding more backend instances without coordination between them.

### AWS Application Load Balancer

The default ALB idle timeout of 60 seconds will cause SSE connections to fail. Increase it to at
least 300 seconds (5 minutes) or higher depending on your use case:

```hcl
resource "aws_lb" "purple_mcp" {
  name               = "purple-mcp-alb"
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  subnets            = var.public_subnets
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.alb.id]

  idle_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes for SSE
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "purple_mcp" {
  name     = "purple-mcp-tg"
  port     = 8000
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = var.vpc_id

  health_check {
    path     = "/health"
    interval = 30
  }

  # Sticky sessions not required - Purple MCP is stateless
  stickiness {
    enabled = false
  }
}
```

Configure your HTTPS listener to forward to this target group and attach an SSL certificate from
ACM. For authentication, you can implement token validation in the application layer or use AWS WAF
rules.

[AWS Guidance for Deploying MCP Servers](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/deploying-model-context-protocol-servers-on-aws/)

### Google Cloud Load Balancing

The default 30 second backend timeout is too short for SSE connections. Set it significantly
higher - 24 hours (86400 seconds) works well:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_backend_service" "purple_mcp" {
  name        = "purple-mcp-backend"
  protocol    = "HTTP"
  timeout_sec = 86400  # 24 hours for SSE

  backend {
    group = google_compute_instance_group_manager.purple_mcp.instance_group
  }

  health_checks = [google_compute_health_check.purple_mcp.id]

  # Session affinity not required - stateless mode
  session_affinity = "NONE"
}

resource "google_compute_health_check" "purple_mcp" {
  name = "purple-mcp-health"

  http_health_check {
    port         = 8000
    request_path = "/health"
  }
}
```

Session affinity is set to `NONE` since Purple MCP doesn't maintain session state. For additional
security, consider using Cloud Armor for DDoS protection and WAF capabilities.

### Azure Application Gateway / Load Balancer

Azure enforces a 4 minute minimum idle timeout, which is the bare minimum for SSE. Configure a
higher value if your deployment allows:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_lb" "purple_mcp" {
  name                = "purple-mcp-lb"
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = "PublicIPAddress"
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.purple_mcp.id
  }
}

resource "azurerm_lb_probe" "purple_mcp" {
  loadbalancer_id     = azurerm_lb.purple_mcp.id
  name                = "purple-mcp-health"
  protocol            = "Http"
  port                = 8000
  request_path        = "/health"
}
```

Session persistence is not required since Purple MCP operates in stateless mode. If the 4 minute
timeout proves insufficient, implement client-side keepalives (sending data every 3 minutes) to
maintain the connection.

For enhanced security, use Azure WAF with Application Gateway or integrate Azure AD for OAuth 2.0
authentication.

### Kubernetes Deployments

If you're running Purple MCP on EKS, GKE, or AKS, configure health probes in your deployment
manifest:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 30

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

Purple MCP operates in stateless mode by default, making it well-suited for Kubernetes deployments.
You can enable horizontal pod autoscaling to handle varying loads, and the load balancer will
distribute requests across pods without requiring session affinity.

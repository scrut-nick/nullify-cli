# Alerts Library

A standalone Python library for interacting with the Unified Alerts Management (UAM) GraphQL API.

## Overview

This library provides a typed, async interface to UAM, handling schema compatibility and providing
robust error handling. It's designed to be completely independent and can be used outside of the
MCP context.

> **📖 Read-Only Library**: This library provides read-only access to the Unified Alerts Management
> system. It supports retrieving alerts, notes, and history, but does not include any data
> modification operations.

## Installation

```bash
pip install purple-mcp
```

## Quick Start

> **Note**: This library is designed for read-only operations and works consistently across all
> usage contexts.

```python
import asyncio
from purple_mcp.libs.alerts import AlertsClient, AlertsConfig

async def main():
    config = AlertsConfig(
        graphql_url="https://console.sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql",
        auth_token="your-bearer-token"
    )

    client = AlertsClient(config)

    # Get a specific alert
    alert = await client.get_alert(alert_id="123")
    if alert:
        print(f"Alert: {alert.name} - Severity: {alert.severity}")

    # List recent alerts
    alerts = await client.list_alerts(first=10)
    print(f"Found {len(alerts.edges)} alerts")

asyncio.run(main())
```

"""Simple logging filter to redact sensitive tokens from log output.

This module provides a lightweight mechanism to prevent sensitive credentials
(tokens, API keys) from appearing in application logs. It works by installing
a logging filter that performs string replacement on log records.

Usage:
    1. Call install_filter() during application startup
    2. Call register_secret() for each sensitive value to redact
    3. All subsequent logs will have secrets replaced with [REDACTED]

Thread-safety:
    This implementation is safe for multi-threaded applications as it only
    reads from the secrets set during filtering operations.

Example:
    >>> from purple_mcp.logging_security import install_filter, register_secret
    >>> install_filter()
    >>> register_secret("my-secret-token")
    >>> logging.info("Token: my-secret-token")  # Logs: Token: [REDACTED]

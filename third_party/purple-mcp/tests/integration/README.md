# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests that verify purple-mcp functionality against real
external services. Unlike unit tests which use mocks, integration tests make actual API calls to
verify end-to-end functionality.

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notice

**Integration tests make real API calls but are read-only safe!**

- Tests only read data from your UAM system (no modifications)
- Tests execute read-only queries against your console
- **Safe to run against release environments** (read-only access)
- Still recommended to use test/development environments for testing
- Ensure you have proper read permissions for UAM access

## Quick Start

1. **Copy the environment template:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   ```

2. **Edit `.env.test` with your real credentials:**

   ```bash
   # Required for all tests
   PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL=https://console.sentinelone.net
   # Note: Token must have Account or Site level permissions (not Global)
   PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
   ```

3. **Install test dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv sync --group test
   ```

4. **Run integration tests:**

   ```bash
   # Run all integration tests
   uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

   # Run only alerts integration tests
   uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_alerts_integration.py -v

   # All tests are read-only safe
   uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v
   ```

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.test` file in the project root with these variables:

```bash
# Console Configuration (Required)
PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL=https://your-console-url.com    # No trailing slash
PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN=your-console-api-token             # API token with Account or Site permissions (not Global)
                                                            # Used for both Console and SDL access
```

### Optional Environment Variables

```bash
# Purple AI Configuration (uses defaults if not specified)
PURPLEMCP_PURPLE_AI_USER_AGENT=TestClient

# Purple AI Console Scope IDs
PURPLEMCP_PURPLE_AI_CONSOLE_TENANT_ID=1234567890123456789
PURPLEMCP_PURPLE_AI_CONSOLE_ACCOUNT_ID=1234567890123456789
PURPLEMCP_PURPLE_AI_CONSOLE_SITE_ID=1234567890123456789

# GraphQL Endpoint (usually don't change)
PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=/web/api/v2.1/graphql
PURPLEMCP_ALERTS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=/web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql
```

### Getting API Tokens

1. **Console Token (`PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN`)**:
   - Log into your SentinelOne console
   - Go to Settings > Users > API Tokens
   - Generate a new token with **Account** or **Site** level permissions (not Global)
   - This token is used for both Console and SDL (PowerQuery) access
   - Copy the token value

### URL Construction

The integration tests automatically construct service URLs:

- **Purple AI**: `{PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL}/web/api/v2.1/graphql`
- **Alerts**: `{PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL}/web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql`
- **SDL**: Uses separate SDL endpoint configuration

## Test Categories

## Automatic Retry Behavior

Integration tests interact with live external services that may experience temporary issues. To
improve reliability, the inventory client (and other clients) automatically retry transient
failures:

### Retry Configuration

- **Retryable errors**: HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway), 503 (Service Unavailable), 504 (Gateway Timeout)
- **Max attempts**: 3 attempts total (initial + 2 retries)
- **Backoff strategy**: Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s between attempts)
- **Non-retryable errors**: All other HTTP errors (400, 401, 404, 500, etc.) fail immediately

### What This Means for Tests

- Tests are resilient to temporary gateway/service issues
- Occasional 5xx responses from upstream services won't cause test failures
- Tests may take longer when retries are triggered (up to ~14 seconds per request)
- If all retries are exhausted, the test will fail with clear error messaging

### When Retries Don't Help

Tests will still fail immediately for non-transient errors:

- Authentication errors (401, 403)
- Client errors (400, 404)
- Internal server errors (500, 501) - these indicate bugs, not transient issues
- Network connectivity issues after retries exhausted

## Test Data and Cleanup

### Data Access (Read-Only)

- Tests only read existing data from your UAM system
- No data creation, modification, or deletion occurs
- Tests work with whatever data exists in your environment
- No cleanup required as no data is modified

### Test Data Requirements

- Tests require existing alerts in the system for full coverage
- Some tests are skipped if no alerts are available
- Performance tests work better with larger datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Environment Not Configured

```
SKIPPED - Integration tests require real environment variables
```

**Solution**: Set up `.env.test` with real values (not example values)

#### Authentication Errors

```
AlertsClientError: HTTP error from alerts API (401)
```

**Solutions**:

- Verify `PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN` is valid and not expired
- Check token permissions for UAM access
- Ensure `PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL` is correct

#### Network/Timeout Errors

```
AlertsClientError: Request timed out while communicating with alerts API
```

**Solutions**:

- Check network connectivity to console
- Verify firewall/proxy settings
- Increase timeout in test configuration
- Check console availability/status

**Note**: Integration tests automatically retry transient failures (502, 503, 504) with exponential
backoff. If you see these errors after retries, the upstream service may be experiencing persistent
issues.

#### API Endpoint Errors

```
AlertsClientError: HTTP error from alerts API (404)
```

**Solutions**:

- Verify UAM is enabled on your console
- Check the GraphQL endpoint URL construction
- Ensure console version supports UAM API

#### Permission Errors

```
AlertsGraphQLError: GraphQL errors in alerts API response
```

**Solutions**:

- Verify token has UAM read permissions
- Check if UAM write permissions needed for note tests
- Review user role and permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed API interactions:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger("purple_mcp.libs.alerts").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

Or set environment variable:

```bash
export PURPLE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### Test Environment Validation

Run environment check without executing tests:

```bash
uv run python -c "
from tests.integration.conftest import is_real_environment
is_real, missing = is_real_environment()
print(f'Environment ready: {is_real}')
if missing:
    print(f'Missing: {missing}')
"
```

## Best Practices

### Safety

1. **Read-only safe** - can run against release environments
2. **Monitor API usage** and rate limits for read operations
3. **Rotate test tokens** periodically for security
4. **Verify read permissions** are sufficient for UAM access
5. **No data cleanup needed** as tests are read-only

### Performance

1. **Run in parallel** when possible (`-n auto`)
2. **Use markers** to run only needed tests
3. **Monitor resource usage** during large tests
4. **Consider timeout settings** for slow networks

### Development

1. **Run integration tests** before major releases
2. **Update tests** when adding new features
3. **Document test scenarios** and expected behaviors
4. **Use fixtures** to avoid code duplication

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Integration Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  integration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.13"
      - name: Install uv
        run: pip install uv
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync --group test
      - name: Run integration tests
        env:
          PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.TEST_CONSOLE_BASE_URL }}
          PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TEST_CONSOLE_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v \
            --timeout=300
```

### Test Secrets Management

- Store credentials in CI/CD secrets, never in code
- Use different tokens for different environments
- Implement token rotation in CI/CD pipelines
- Monitor token usage and expiration

## Support

For issues with integration tests:

1. **Check this README** for common solutions
2. **Review test output** for specific error messages
3. **Enable debug logging** for detailed API interactions
4. **Verify environment setup** with validation commands
5. **Check console logs** for server-side issues

Integration tests are critical for ensuring purple-mcp works correctly with real SentinelOne
environments. Run them regularly but safely!

"""Best-effort MCP call telemetry — fire-and-forget mcp_call_event emission.

Records one event per tool call at the FastMCP dispatch boundary.
Failures are always suppressed so telemetry never interrupts tool callers.

Event flow:
    mcp-server → portal → telemetry-collector → NATS → blob →
    telemetry-platform (tagged with the deployment's customer_id)

Identity contract
-----------------
Browser / device-flow sessions:
    /auth/me returns a JWT sub or email; resolved once and cached.

API-key sessions (LATENT_DEFENSE_API_KEY set, /auth/me returns 401):
    /auth/me does not accept API keys. A stable entity_id is derived by
    hashing the key: "apikey:<sha256[:16]>". This is distinct per key,
    non-reversible, and requires no auth-service changes.

Transient failures (network blip, device-flow pending):
    "unknown" is returned but NOT cached; the next call retries.
